This program is an extension of the official solution of the DEBS Grand Challenge 2011 which was made by EsperTech using Complex Event Processing(CEP) Engine Esper. 
It is a web application which needs a web server to run on. 
It has been created using the ultimate version of IntelliJ Idea from JetBrains and tested using Apache Tomcat 9.0.
Extended statements in the trivia.epl file were tested using the testcases which the official solution from esper provides.
